Final Project

This project solves 4 problem sets for data structures and algorithms final it consists of 4 classes for each problem set.

Installation 

Unzip the project file and import or open it in any IDE open any of the classes to see it and run it.


Running the programs (parameters)

Problem1 input format : One line contains a string 

Problem2 input format : first line contains the redundancy ratio r as a real number greater than 1.
                   
                        Next lines contain integers one per line. 

Problem3 input format : First line : 3 integers space separated n (the number of islands),m (the number of one-way bridges),
                                     and r (the index of the island you are initially on).

                        Next m lines : Two space separated integers ui and vi representing a one-way bridge from island ui to vi. 

Problem4 input format : First line : will contain two space separated integers n and m where n denotes the number of nodes and 
                                     m denotes the number of edges in the graph respectively.
 
                        The next m lines contain two integers ui and vi denoting an undirected edge between the vertices ui and vi.
